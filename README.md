# 🎬 Movie Watch Pattern Clustering

This project explores clustering techniques on user movie-watching patterns. It includes both classification and unsupervised learning tasks, such as generating heatmaps for confusion matrices, calculating evaluation metrics, and clustering users based on behavioral data.

## 📌 Objective

To cluster users based on:
- ⏰ **Time of watching**
- 🎞️ **Genre preference**
- ⭐ **Rating behavior**

The project also includes evaluation of classification models (if used) with:
- Confusion matrix heatmaps
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics
